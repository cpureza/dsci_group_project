    "#### *METHODS*\n",
    "We strive to discover the significance of the country of origin and age of a tennis player when looking at their chances to win prizes. To achieve this goal, we will examine how many players there are per country and their age, and compare it with the amount of money made per country.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **country column** to derive how many players there are per country, then the **age and prize money columns** to assess the correlation between the variables. In order to reduce bias, we will compare the **average ranking** of all the players in  countries when drawing conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **histograms** to visualize how much money different age groups make, and **bar graphs** to visualize how much money different countries make. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND SIGNIFICANCE*\n",
    "\n",
    "***What do you expect to find?*** \\\n",
    "Knowing the US's competitive nature, we expect **US players** to earn the most prize money out of all the countries given in our data set. We also expect **younger players** to make more overall given their potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "***What impact could such findings have?*** \\\n",
    "Obtaining evidence on the top earning players’ ethnicity could reveal potential **biases** or underlying **discrimination** towards a country in tennis. As more research is done towards sport-related biases (such as age and ethnicity), we hope that the insights provided by research can aspire the sports industry to make **fair** and **inclusive** sporting events for all players. In the perspective of tennis coaches, this data could be used to recruit prospective tennis players.\n",
    "\n",
    "***What future questions could this lead to?***\n",
    "Since our data analysis is only limited to tennis, it poses the question if other sports, such as soccer, football, and baseball, **have the same biases?** If not, what other predictors would have more weight than predictors used in our predicting model? "
